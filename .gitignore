# Include these three ignore instructions in your repo:
# ignore imported sketch files
**/*.sketch
# don't ignore imported sketch *folders* (these are generated by grunt sketch tasks)
!**/.sketch/
# but _do_ ignore user.json files under these folders; those are user-specific files
**/.sketch/user.json

# lastly, don't ignore the original sketch files put in this repo just for reference
# (you don't need this instruction; the whole point is not having any sketch files in your repo)
